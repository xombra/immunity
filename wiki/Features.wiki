#labels Featured,Phase-Design

 * switches to a shadow user with the name "immunity-$USER" and the home dir "/var/lib/immunity/$USER" to avoid any dangerous interprocess communication, debugging, signals, ...
 * switches to group "immunity" that allows easy definition of filesystem ACLs and netfilter rules
 * reduce the set of supplementary groups to "audio"
 * works with a vanilla Linux kernel and does not need any external modules
 * does not need packages not available in Debian or other major distros
 * does depend on features of the Linux kernel and won't work with other non Linux kernels
 * does not need SELinux or any other complex security framework
 * employs polyinstantiation of the filesystem
 * narrows the filesystem in the container
   * only parts of /etc, /dev, /usr, /var and other parts of the filesystem can be seen in the container
   * no /boot, /home, /media, /mnt, /root, /sbin, /sys, ...
   * /proc will be optional in the future; /proc/bus/usb has already been disabled
 * disables all suid and sgid binaries
 * reduces number of device files to {{{/dev/null}}} and {{{/dev/snd/*}}} (alsa)
 * locks down all capabilities; they can't be regained from user space
 * implemented in Python
 * transfers X authorization to the shadow user; optional feature in the future
